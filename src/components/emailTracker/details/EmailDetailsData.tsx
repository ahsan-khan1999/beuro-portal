        Hi Rahal,
        <br />
        <br />
        Hope you are healthy and doing well.
        <br />
        <br />I am Neha Kamat, currently studying MA in Mass Communication from
        XYZ College. I came to know via LinkedIn that there are openings in the
        Journalism department in ABC News Agency and I think I would be able to
        do justice to this role because of my experiences in the related field.
        <br />
        <br />
        I have worked as a full-time journalist in a news agency, wherein I was
        assigned to a promising project regarding Indian education. My role
        included Covering news from the villages in India focusing on the
        education aspect, Editing, Developing, and Curating content for their
        website. As an English major, I am used to writing and reading a variety
        of articles and essays. I am a voracious reader and have read books from
        various genres.
        <br />
        <br />I have my own blog where I generally write all my creative stuff.
        Another major thing that I have in my basket is that Iâ€™ve interned as a
        content writer in a firm. My job was to take telephonic interviews with
        influential people from the endangered tribes of India and curate an
        article based on that. This internship gave me an opportunity to hone my
        communication skills and receive information in an empathetic way. My
        education in the English field and the work I have done have helped me
        get in-depth knowledge about mass media as well. Please find attached my
        CV below for your reference. If I'm hired, I would give my best to help
        ABC News Agency reach greater heights.
